# Nychthemeron Stream

Nychthemeron Stream is a portable streaming setup that can be deployed on any docker compatible system.

Based on ffmpeg it is lightweight than other streaming clients like OBS and Streamlabs OBS and allows streaming to one or more site simultaneously

Any site that uses the RTMP protocol is supported these include

- Twitch
- Youtube live
- Facebook live
- Periscope

Made with [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) in mind to create minimal bloat and modular system

We can also redirect the stream to aws or google cloud where we can use AI and image processing to provide interesting overlays like multi-language caption by using natural language processing and then translating it.

It can ideal for the following situations

- Minimal Resource streaming for low end devices like raspberry pi

- Use it to stream 24x7 streams from a server and make a radio channel/ tv channel sort of thing.

- Use it to for production of media like news or esports live stream to display interesting overlay like headshot count etc all powered by AI
